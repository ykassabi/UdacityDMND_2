"Success in life sucks!" I challenge you to find someone that believes in it! We are genetically programmed to thrive and seek happiness. Trust me on this one!
But first, let me introduce myself: my name is Youssef. I'm a Biochemist who worked in Research for a couple of years. Although I liked it, I did not see myself doing this for the rest of my life so I switched to Web Programming. I learned JavaScript and Ruby Languages on my own. To be honest, sitting in front of my laptop- typing, getting stuck, googling for an answer and trying to solve problems- may look like torture to you but the joy of solving one bug, I cannot tell you how emotionally rewarding it is. Surely I enjoy it! But coding regularly did alienate me from the user - the person that will benefit from all the hard work.
With time I discovered I had a blind spot in my professional life. The most stable, perfect code will not bring more users, it will never be memorable, not even for a few hours. I had to understand more about the user's needs and gain a new perspective on the customerâ€™s journey as well as knowing how to reach new users and to optimize my code to be well understood by robots (like Google bots). In order to achieve this, I had to find a program that would teach me the full spectrum of digital marketing. I stumbled on Digital Marketing- Nano Degree- check it out https://rebrand.ly/9k55ug1. This program is insightful and well structured. It is helping a lot to build a better website and to have access to the overall picture.
