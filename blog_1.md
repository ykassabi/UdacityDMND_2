"success in life sucks!"  I challenge you to find someone that believes it! we are programmed genetically to thrive and seek happiness. Trust me on this! 

But first, let me introduce myself, my name is Youssef. I'm Biochemist, I worked in research for a couple of years, I liked it but not enough to do it for the rest of my life. So I switch to web programming. I self-taught JavaScript, ruby languages. and Frankly, sitting in front of my laptop, typing, getting stuck, googling for an answer and trying to solve problems looks like torture, the joy of solving one bug, I can not tell you how emotionally rewarding. Surely I enjoy it. But coding regularly did alienate me from the user, the person that will benefit from all the hard word.  
With time I discovered I have a blind spot in my professional life. The most stable, perfect code will not bring more users, it will never be memorable even for a few hours. I had to understand more about the user's needs, to gain a new perspective on the customer journey. to know how to reach new users and to optimize my code to be well understood by robots(like google bots)as well appealing for users. To achieve this I have to find a program that will teach me the full spectrum of digital marketing. I stumbled on Digital Marketing Nano Degree, check it out https://rebrand.ly/9k55ug1.
This program is insightful and well structured. it is helping a lot to build a better website and to see the whole picture.
